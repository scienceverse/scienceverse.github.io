Lisa DeBruine gave a Papercheck workshop at the [Festival of Data Science and AI](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/datascience/events/festival/#1.30-5pm%3Aresearchliteraturedemonstration) at the University of Glasgow in Scotland.

We had an in-depth demonstration of how Papercheck might be useful for systematic reviews.
